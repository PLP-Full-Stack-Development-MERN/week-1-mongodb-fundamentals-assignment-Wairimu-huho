📚 Library Database Project

This project demonstrates MongoDB operations for managing a Library database, including data creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, aggregation, and indexing. It also includes basic e-commerce collections like users, products, and orders.

🚀 Project Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Prerequisites

MongoDB installed locally or access to a MongoDB cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or any MongoDB GUI tool like MongoDB Compass.

2️⃣ Setting Up the Database

✅ Step 1: Start MongoDB

If running locally, start MongoDB using:

mongod

Then, connect using:

mongosh

✅ Step 2: Create the Database

Create a new database named Library.

✅ Step 3: Add Collections and Data

Create collections such as books, users, products, and orders.

Insert relevant sample data into these collections.

3️⃣ Performing Database Operations

🔎 Data Retrieval

Retrieve data from collections using queries based on fields like author and published year.

📝 Data Updates

Update fields such as publishedYear or add new fields like rating to documents.

🗑️ Data Deletion

Delete specific documents or entire sets based on query conditions.

4️⃣ Data Analysis with Aggregation

Use aggregation pipelines to count items per category, calculate averages, or find top-rated entries.

5️⃣ Optimizing Queries with Indexing

Create indexes on frequently queried fields to enhance performance.

Test indexing efficiency with performance analysis commands.

🎯 Final Checks

Run commands step by step in MongoDB shell.

Confirm data retrieval, updates, deletions, and aggregations work as expected.

Validate performance improvements using indexing.

💡 Your MongoDB Library database setup is now complete. Happy querying! 🚀
